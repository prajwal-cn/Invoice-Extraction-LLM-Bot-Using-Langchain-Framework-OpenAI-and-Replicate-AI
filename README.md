## About

The Invoice Extraction LLM Bot is a Streamlit-powered web application that leverages a Language Model (LLM) to extract key data from uploaded invoice PDFs. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to upload their invoices, and the bot processes the PDFs to extract essential information such as invoice number, description, quantity, date, unit price, amount, total, email, phone number, and address.

This project demonstrates the use of natural language processing and document parsing techniques to automate the extraction of structured data from unstructured PDF documents.
